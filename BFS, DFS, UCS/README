- edit grading-agent.pl and modify the refdir value to point to the absolute path to the "reference" directory

- type:

./grading_agent.pl /home/scf-34/sakhalka/cs561-f14/laurent

1. 

Kindly consider this test case. In the following case, the output posted in the discussion forum is :

0 0 2 4 4 0 0
10 0 0 4 0 6 2
0 0 0 0 6 0 2
0 0 0 0 2 2 0

DFS:-
A-B-C-D-E-D-F
A-E-F
16


#MY OUTPUT IS:

Log: A-B-C-D-E-F
Path: A-E-F
Cost: 16

As per my algorithm, I am traversing the nodes and once they are being traversed and explored , that is, marked visited and appended 
to the path then if the node in the path comes again while traversing (even if of lesser cost) then it is not considered. Its visited
status is false. So, as per my algorithm, it is not visited again. I am assuming that the DFS algorithm does not always give an optimal
path.
